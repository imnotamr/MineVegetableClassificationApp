# 🌱 Vegetable Classification App
This project features a Vegetable Classification App, built using a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The app allows users to upload images of vegetables and receive accurate classifications, along with confidence scores for each category.
Check out the App ---> [Vegetable Classification App](https://blank-app-tvutcovnwoe.streamlit.app/) 

# 🚀 Features
### 🖼️ Image Upload:
Upload vegetable images (JPG, PNG, or JPEG formats).
### 🧠 Deep Learning Model:
Utilizes a CNN trained on 15 vegetable classes for high accuracy.
### 📊 Confidence Scores:
Visualizes classification probabilities with a bar chart.
### 🌐 Streamlit Deployment:
Easy-to-use interface accessible via a web browser.

# 🌟 How It Works
## Upload an Image:
Users upload a vegetable image in JPG/PNG format.
## Model Prediction:
The app uses the pre-trained CNN to classify the vegetable.
## Display Results:
Predicted vegetable name and Confidence scores for all 15 classes, displayed as a bar chart.
### Supported Vegetable Classes:
Bean, Bitter_Gourd, Bottle_Gourd, Brinjal, Broccoli, Cabbage, Capsicum, Carrot, Cauliflower, Cucumber, Papaya, Potato, Pumpkin, Radish, Tomato
